### ~The Innovative Tech Braille for Enhanced Accessibility 

EchoEyes is a Python script designed to provide screen-reading capabilities for visually impaired users. It captures and reads the content of the screen around the cursor, making it accessible and user-friendly. With EchoEyes, you can choose to read the entire screen or focus on content near the cursor, customize the voice, adjust reading speed, and more.

## :dart:Our Vision:

- Every person deserves equal access to information and education. And navigating the digital world can be a daunting task for the visually impaired. We need to recognize the power of technology to unlock new possibilities.

- So we have tried to create a gateway to remove visual barriers and enable the users to absorb educational material offered through screen share. Our project will remove visual barriers by enabling users to consume educational material being presented by screen sharing.

## Features üöÄ

- Screen capture using OpenCV.
- Optical Character Recognition (OCR) with pytesseract.
- Text-to-speech conversion using gTTS (Google Text-to-Speech).
- Customizable voice type and reading speed.
- Option to read the whole screen or content around the cursor.
- Easy-to-use Python script.
